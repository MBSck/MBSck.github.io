    My name is Marten Scheuck. I am pursuing my PhD in astronomy at the Max-Planck-Institute of Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg.<br><br>
    I am especially interested in combining up-to-date programming techniques with observational data.<br><br>
    A few hobbies of mine are:
    <ul>
      <li>Coding in my freetime (<a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>)</li>
      <li>Playing the guitar and the piano</li>
      <li>Sports
        <ul>
          <li>Doing karate (空手) - Paused right now</li>
          <li>Jogging and I ordered a <a href="https://www.carver.de/products/gravel-220-p000000210">Carver Gravel bike</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Standard & Latin dancing (and Salsa) - Paused right now</li>
      <li>Learning...
        <ul>
          <li>Languages (at the moment: Japanese & Spanish)</li>
          <li>Physics; repeating the foundations to intuitively understand them (using the <a href="https://nononsensebooks.com/qft/">no-nonsense books</a>)</li>

      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    </header>
    <p>My research is focused on the <span style="font-weight:bold">structure of protoplanetary disks</span>
      using the <span style="font-weight:bold">MATISSE (Multi-Aperture mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment)</span>
      instrument.<br>
      I am particularly interested in the <span style="font-weight:bold">inner regions of the circumstellar disks</span>
      (i.e., the region within a few astronomical units of the central star) where it is most likely for terrestrial planets
      to form.</br>
      <br>I am currently working on the <span style="font-weight:bold">HD 142666</span> system, a Herbig Ae/Be star with a
      multi-ringed inner disk. The aim of my research is to understand the <span style="font-weight:bold">asymmetries</span>
      in the structure of the inner disk and their implications for the formation of planets.</br>
      <br>My work involves the analysis of interferometric observations in the mid-infrared wavelength range (H, K, L and M bands),
        and also includes the modeling of the disk structure using (simplified) radiative transfer codes (temperature gradients).</br>
      <br>I am working on this under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Dr. Thomas Henning and Dr. Roy van Boekel at the
        Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA), Heidelberg, Germany</br></p>

		<h2>Work projects (My Affiliation)</h2>
		<a href="https://github.com/oimodeler/oimodeler" target="_blank"><h3 style="color:#49bf9d">&bull; oimodeler (Contributor):</h3></a>
		<p>A modular modelling tool for optical interferometry writen among others by members of the MATISSE consortium
      in order to present an easy to use tool for the whole of the optical and generally the interferometric community.</p>
		<a href="https://github.com/MBSck/ppdmod" target="_blank"><h3 style="color:#49bf9d">&bull; ppdmod (Owner):</h3></a>
		<p>An interferometric modelling tool, which I am step by step integrating into oimodeler (it will then be archived).</p>
		<a href="https://github.com/MBSck/matadrs" target="_blank"><h3 style="color:#49bf9d">&bull; matadrs (Owner):</h3></a>
		<p>The (modular) MATISSE Automated Data Reduction Software (Matadrs) is a tool written (with some code adapted from colleagues) to encompass all the individual steps and
		files needed to procure and reduce data generally and easily in as few steps as possible with the least knowledge required. To make it possible
		for seasoned MATISSE users to quickly and easily reduce data and giving others who are interested in MATISSE data the opportunity to do so as well.</p>
		<a href="https://github.com/Matisse-Consortium/p2obt" target="_blank"><h3 style="color:#49bf9d">&bull; p2obt (Owner):</h3></a>
		<p>The Phase 2 OB preparation tool (p2obt) is made to streamline/automate the process of MATISSE observation preparation on p2
      (can theoretically also be adapted for all other VLTI instruments, if templates are added).</p>

		<h2>Personal projects</h2>
		<a href="https://github.com/MBSck/fourim" target="_blank"><h3 style="color:#49bf9d">&bull; Fourim:</h3></a>
		<p>(Work in progress) Fourim is an interactive tool to visualise the amplitudes and phases seen during interferometric observations.</p>
