		<p>A modular modelling tool for optical interferometry.</p>
		<a href="https://github.com/MBSck/ppdmod" target="_blank"><h3 style="color:#49bf9d">&bull; ppdmod (Owner):</h3></a>
		<p>An interferometric modelling tool, which I am step by step integrating into oimodeler (it will then be archived).</p>

		<p>The (modular) MATISSE Automated Data Reduction Software (Matadrs) is a tool written (with some code adapted from colleagues) to encompass all the individual steps and
		files needed to procure and reduce data generally and easily in as few steps as possible with the least knowledge required. To make it possible
		for seasoned MATISSE users to quickly and easily reduce data and giving others who are interested in MATISSE data the opportunity to do so as well.</p>
		<a href="https://github.com/Matisse-Consortium/p2obp" target="_blank"><h3 style="color:#49bf9d">&bull; p2obp (Owner):</h3></a>
		<p>The Phase 2 OB Pipeline (p2obp) is made to streamline/automate the process of MATISSE observation preparation on p2 (can theoretically also be used
      for all other VLTI instruments, if templates are adapted).</p>

		<p>This was the final course project of an advanced Python class. It is an extremly simplified simulation of planetary bodies' movement.
		Will be updated steadily and at some point made into a 3D form.</p>
