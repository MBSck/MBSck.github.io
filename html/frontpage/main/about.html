  <p>My name is Marten Scheuck. I am <span id="age"></span> years old and at the moment pursuing my PhD in astronomy
  at the Max-Planck-Institute of Astronomy in Heidelberg (MPIA).<br><br>
	It has always been my dream to contribute to contemporary science. This is why I decided on conducting research in the field of astronomy.<br>
	I am especially interested in combining up-to-date programming techniques with observational data.<br><br>
	A few hobbies of mine are digital drawing, coding in my freetime, and a few other things, such as playing the piano/guitar, dancing, learning languages and doing karate (空手).</p>
