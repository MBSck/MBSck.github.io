		</header>
    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Marten Scheuck. I am 25 years old and at the moment pursuing my PhD in astronomy at the Max-Planck-Institute of Astronomy in Heidelberg.<br><br>
		It has always been my dream to contribute to the contemporary science and do so in the field of astronomy.<br>
		I am especially interested in combining up-to-date programming techniques with observational data.<br><br>
		A few hobbies of mine are digital drawing, coding in my freetime, and a few other things, such as playing the piano/guitar, dancing, learning languages and doing 空手 (karate).</p>
