  <p>My research is focused on the <span style="font-weight:bold">structure of protoplanetary disks</span>
    using the <span style="font-weight:bold">MATISSE (Multi-Aperture mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment)</span>
    instrument.<br>
    I am particularly interested in the <span style="font-weight:bold">inner regions of the circumstellar disks</span>
    (i.e., the region within a few astronomical units of the central star) where it is most likely for terrestrial planets
    to form.</br>
    <br>I am currently working on the <span style="font-weight:bold">HD 142666</span> system, a Herbig Ae/Be star with a
    multi-ringed inner disk. The aim of my research is to understand the <span style="font-weight:bold">asymmetries</span>
    in the structure of the inner disk and their implications for the formation of planets.</br>
    <br>My work involves the analysis of interferometric observations in the mid-infrared wavelength range (H, K, L and M bands),
      and also includes the modeling of the disk structure using (simplified) radiative transfer codes (temperature gradients).</br>
    <br>I am working on this under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Dr. Thomas Henning and Dr. Roy van Boekel at the
      Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA), Heidelberg, Germany</br></p>
