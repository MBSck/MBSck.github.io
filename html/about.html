  <p>My name is Marten Scheuck. I am at the moment pursuing my PhD in astronomy
  at the Max-Planck-Institute of Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg.<br><br>
	It has always been my dream to contribute to contemporary science. This is why I decided on conducting research in the field of astronomy.<br>
	I am especially interested in combining up-to-date programming techniques with observational data.<br><br>
